pangu
-----

Pangu is a very simple data generating library that uses an XML grammar to 
generate documents of various types. Currently we can generate XML and JSON 
documents using pangu but you can build a simple document formatter to generate
documents of other types.

Here you'll find all of the documentation written for this library including
some design documentation on decisions made about the way pangu works with the
grammar languages and compiles them into a neutral structure to generate 
documents from.
